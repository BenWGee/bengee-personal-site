- Create notes [here](https://github.com/BenWGee/dnd/tree/main/source/content/PCs/Davpos%20-%20Personal)
- Create as many notes and sub folders as you like under "PCs/YOUR_CHARACTER_NAME - Person"
- You do not need to do this for your notes. But if you do it will create a new page on the website with your notes. 
- If you have another note taking app/website we can look at integrating it into this, but I make no promises. 
# Prerequisites
- Create a GitHub account
- Send me your GitHub username/email to get added as a "Collaborator" on the site
- No coding required!
# How To Make Notes
1. Go [here](https://github.com/BenWGee/dnd/tree/main/source/content/PCs/Davpos%20-%20Personal)
2. Click on your folder
3. Under your folder click "Add file"
	- You can create new or upload a local file
	- Ensure your file is a markdown file (.md)
	- Markdown works just like a plain text file but you can also add in some fancy visuals such as headings, italics etc. 
	- Or just ignore all that stuff and just use it as plain text. 
4. Click "Commit Changes"
5. There will be a pop-up click "Commit Changes" again.
6. After a while your md file will appear on the website as a new page under your characters folder. 
7. You can upload other kinds of files here too. However, it will not render on the website unless it is an md file. You can still use this website as a home for other files related to the campaign. E.g PDF character sheet.
8. You are welcome to create multiple little notes, or just one massive note with everything in one place. Whatever suits you better.
