  # My Background
  I have worked in an IT role for several years. This has lead to a constant back and forth managing business and IT needs. My key skill is translating technical concepts into business value. It is not enough to explain a technical concept. Messages need to be tailored towards their audience.

  My academic background is in physics, and data science. These subjects are often masked in technical jargon, formula, and dense concepts. Science is only valuable when we can apply it. Through these studies, and practicing I aim to make complex concepts easy to understnad.
