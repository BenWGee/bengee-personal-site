### Work Experience

## Unum Infrastructure Engineer

June 2021 - Present

This role involved carrying on my task as intern for Unum’s monitoring team as well as taking on new responsibilities such as on call work, and being involved in new projects. This includes migrating the enterprise’s existing logging to Splunk Cloud, moving from an in-house monitoring tool to Nagios XI/Dynatrace. Additionally, I worked as part of an agile engineer team to develop a dashboard to display monitoring data, and visualize the enterprise applications.

This task involves the use of Service Now, Nagios Xi, Solar Winds, Dynatrace, and SCOM data. Data was compiled into a compact dashboard to aid in IT diagnostics, and informing our customers of their monitors, status, and severity. 

### Clericus Data Visualisation

July 2019 - August 2019

Undertook 6 weeks work in the Digital Humanities Institute under Professor Thomas O’Connor. Here I analysed the data of over 9000 priests who were ordained in St Patricks University over the past 100 years. I constructed plots based on ordinations, grades, and demographics with the aim of spotting trends in the population over time. The tools I made are planned to be implemented in a web based application to track the history of priests in Ireland.

### Collaborative Annotation UI/UX Designer

June 2019 - July 2019

For 4 weeks in the Summer of 2019. Worked as the UX/UI designer in the Maynooth University Computer Science department. Here I designed a piece of collaborative annotation software with 3 other developers. The project entailed designing an in browser piece of software to promote learning between groups of students through the use of collaborative annotation. The software is planned to go on trial in the coming years as part of a future project to test if collaborate annotation is more effective than traditional teaching methods.
