Commodore Krux is a Giff based on the Rock of Bral. While he spends much of his time in the [[Happy Beholder]] he still enjoys adventuring out onto the Astral Sea. 

When not sailing the seas he rents out his vessels to up-and-coming adventurers and privateers. 

Krux has worked with [[Elaina Sartell]] in the past and is happy to help the players when they mention her name.
