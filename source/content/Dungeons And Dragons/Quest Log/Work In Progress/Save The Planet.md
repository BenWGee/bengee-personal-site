So your planet has been destroyed...
- Having see your planet become ravaged by large crystalline vines all hope seems lost. 
- Speaking with Astral Elves that attacked you as you fled your home something seems amiss. 
- [[Commodore Krux]] seems to have alluded to the Astral Elves destroying planets regularly. He mentioned this with venom and hurt in his voice. 
- Krux made reference to the crystal vines taking much longer to ravage a planet than the Astral Elves let on. Could there be a way to still save the planet?
