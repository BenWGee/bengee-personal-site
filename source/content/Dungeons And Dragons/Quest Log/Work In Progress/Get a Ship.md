- The Rock is nice but to even think about leaving we need a ship.
- [[Commodore Krux]] seems to own some ships, they might be able to sell one or know someone who can.
- To sail the astral seas we need a Spelljamming help. This requires a 5th level spell slot to make or we pay someone who can. A helm can run us 5K-10K+ gold according to Krux.
