title: Welcome to my Dungeons & Dragons Campaign
---
# Intro
Hello, welcome to my little page. This is meant for members of my D&D campaign to catch up and find useful information.

If you are a member of the campaign please avoid any notes in a folder clearly titled or tagged GM. We wouldn't want any spoilers :)

This campaign is based on the "Spelljammer Adventures in Space" series of books for D&D 5th edition. 

You can find relevant files under the "Dungeons And Dragons" folder.
There is also a folder per character:
- [[Ahrni - Visible For All]]
- [[Davpos - Visible For All]]
- [[Jasper - Visible For All]]
- [[Oakheart - Visible For All]]
- [[Quests]]
