## Comms Centre
As you step into the Communication Center of the Library of Spheres, the atmosphere shifts from the bustling energy of The Rock of Bral to a more focused, administrative environment. The air is filled with a soft hum of machinery and the faint crackle of magical energy, creating an ambiance that is both serene and purposeful. The room is spacious, with high ceilings adorned with intricate murals depicting the cosmos—stars, planets, and swirling nebulae that seem to dance in the flickering light of enchanted orbs suspended from above. The walls are lined with shelves filled with scrolls, tomes, and crystalline devices, each containing knowledge and messages from across the multiverse. At the center of the room, a large, circular desk made of polished obsidian serves as the main hub for communication. Behind it, a team of clerks and scholars, each wearing robes that reflect the colors of the cosmos, diligently attend to the needs of visitors. They are busy transcribing messages, sending missives, and consulting the vast archives of the library. To your left, a series of enchanted terminals allow members of the public to send and receive messages to and from their home planet, Total. Each terminal is equipped with a crystal orb that glows softly, responding to the touch of those seeking to connect with loved ones or gather information. A sign above the terminals reads: "Connect with Your World – Messages Sent Across the Stars." On the right side of the room, a waiting area is furnished with comfortable chairs and small tables, where patrons can peruse the latest news from Total or engage in quiet conversation. A large bulletin board displays announcements, requests for aid, and news from various factions and individuals, all seeking to connect with the wider universe. The air is filled with the scent of parchment and ink, mingling with the faint aroma of exotic spices wafting in from a nearby café. The atmosphere is one of hope and urgency, as individuals from all walks of life gather here, seeking to bridge the distance between worlds and share their stories. As you take in the scene, you can’t help but feel the weight of the cosmos pressing down upon you, a reminder of the vastness of existence and the connections that bind all beings together, even in the face of adversity.
