# Plot

- The players were directed to the unassuming entrance of Xenotermination LTD

"""
As you make your way through the bustling streets of The Rock of Bral, the sounds of merchants hawking their wares and the chatter of passersby fill the air. You follow the directions you were given, weaving through narrow alleys and crowded thoroughfares until you finally arrive at a modest two-story building that seems to blend into its surroundings.

The structure is unassuming, with weathered stone and dark timber that give it a rustic charm. A small, unlit sign hangs above the door, its faded gold lettering barely legible. You can make out the name "Xenotermination LTD," but it seems almost forgotten, as if the building has been overlooked by the city for some time.

As you approach, you notice the heavy wooden door, reinforced with iron bands, standing resolutely closed. Narrow windows on either side are draped with thick curtains, obscuring any view of the interior. A low stone wall surrounds the building, with a few potted plants adding a touch of life to the otherwise muted exterior.

You glance at each other, a mix of curiosity and apprehension in the air. The atmosphere feels charged with anticipation as those cryptic words hang in your mind.

What do you do?

- A DC 15 perception/investigation check reveals a hatch in the door
- As the players get closer a hatch will open in the door
- The unknown person behind the door [[Vespera Vex Thorne]]
- They will speak to the player in thieve's can't "Sarum are oe here"
	- Translation: Why are you here?
- If the players make their way inside and tell their tale they will be escorted to a room where they must complete a combat trial. 
- The room contains a projection of a mind flayer and two intellect devourers. This is meant as a test of the characters skill. They will fight viciously but they will not die if the encounter is failed.
