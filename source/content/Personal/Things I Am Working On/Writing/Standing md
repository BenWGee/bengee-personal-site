Standing

We stand on the shoulders of giants
Seasann muid ar ghuaillí fathach

But when I hug you
ach nuair a chuirfinn barróg ort

I knock the glasses off your head
Buailim na spéaclaí le do cheann

Your house is home
is do theach baile

With furniture made of real timber
teach ina bhfuil adhmad ina adhmad

A roaring fire at the center
An tine mhór sa lár

I owe so much to you
Tuillte agat é ar fad

So much you'll never know
níos mó le gach lá
