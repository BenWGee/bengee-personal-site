Jack followed his watch to the second. He arrived early to the bus stop yet now he is late. Jack stood among a sea of people, commuters, students, junkies. Everyone has a place to be. 

The passengers swayed like a great wave as it reached the destination. Jacked walk to the "Reeds" café , a usual spot when he worked in town. A line of people snaked around the block. Jack was five minutes late. He moved past the queue and spotted her. Mary sat across from an empty chair. The café moved. Steam fogged the barista"s glases. Chatted filled the room with a low hum. Jack headed for the seat. " Jack O"Toole." he said. He offered a hand, clammy, full of nrves. " Mary Kavanaghm it"s nice to finally meet in person." She shook his hand. It was cold. 

Her coffee was finished. Mary ordered them both a drink. Jack seemed to relax once the coffee arrived. 

"Have you come here before?" Jack said. " I used to be a regular. I was friends with the owner." she said. Mary scans the room. "I painted that one." she said. Jack follows her eyes. Hanging above a table at the end of the cafe is a square canvas. It depicts the main street as it was one-hundred years ago. The shops have changed, the cobblestone street has stayed the same. "Do you still paint?" Jack said. "I try" Mary said.  The sentence hung in the air. Jack took a long sip of coffee. Maybe he could find something to break the silence inside. Inhaling the last drops he found it. Jack began to cough. He was choking like a child first learning to eat. "Are you alright." Mary said. Jack saw her face drop. It felt like an eternity. "Thank you, I'm fine" he said. Jack's face was red, eyes wide. The pair were in a trance. They stared at each other. Finally, Mary broke into laughter. "Let's go for a walk." Mary said. She gathered herself, leaving a messy bundle of cash on the table.
