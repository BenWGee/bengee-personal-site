Prompt: Re-write the first chapter of Junji Ito's "Sensor" in an Irish setting. 

It was about a year ago. I was up in the hills near Muckross house. Da would take me up there when I was small. It's a beautiful spot. You can see the lakes down below, and Carrantuathil peaking up from behind you. The Carran bit means sickle, or spike. It's not a big mountain. The folks in Kenya and Nepal have us well beat. I climbed it one year with da. I was only a pip and he was a smoker of thirty year. I looked down on Muckross and the lakes. It was some spot.

Back to that day anyway, I was wandering round Muckross by meself. Da was awat. A forest surrounds the old manor hourse. I walked into the forest to be from the tourists I suppose. 

As I walked there was a bit of a clearing. I felt something touch my face. I thought it was silk. Some poor spider home I barged through. But no, it was a fasbulous gold colorur. It was delicte.It melted away like dry kindling in the fire. It reminded me of the stories. Da used to tell of the other folk. A tall beautiful sort. T'was important to keep your wits about you. 

I continued on and came on a yound man. Looked in his thirys, save for a few fair strands hidden in the black mop. He was away with it. O have no mond to hm and tried to walk past, not wanting to bother him. It was only when I passed he said "You're one of Maher's aren't you?" I don't know how he knew. He hardly looked at me. "Sure I might be" I says back to him. "We were told you'd be coming" he said. The golden threads danced around him like a cloud of ash. 

"You'll come by the hosue won't you?" he said. An instruction disguised as a question." I need to be back before the father gets worried" I said. "T'is no need for that Seamus, we'll have you sorted" he said. I followed the man along the forest. I spotted a well tread path. He kept tight to it. He didn't want to disturb those living in the tall grass. 

The trees began to part ways. We arrived at a grand farmhouse. Is roof was thatched with the golden thread. The very same kind that greeted me earlier A gold veneer covered the roof, fields, and paths. It gave everything a luster. It wasn't a cheap shine, a craftsman blessed this place. 

I thought to myself, where could it all have come from? It wuold have taken years to gather. Before I could ask the man already replied "It is a gift. Tuathal's spirit blessed this place. His hair normally fades away, but here it stays."

We continued on. The sights were something else. The thread was everywhere. It draped over crows like a veil, it flowed down the stream. I saw a man praying by the water. A few strands drapped over his bald head.
