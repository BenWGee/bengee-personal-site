**Prompt**: Re-write the first chapter of Junji Ito's "Sensor" in an Irish setting. 

It was about a year ago. I was up in the hills near Muckross house. Da would take me up there when I was small. It's a beautiful spot. You can see the lakes down below, and Carrantuathil peaking up from behind you. The Carran bit means sickle, or spike. It's not a big mountain. The folks in Kenya and Nepal have us well beat. I climbed it one year with da. I was only a pip and he was a smoker of thirty year. I looked down on Muckross and the lakes. It was some spot.

Back to that day anyway, I was wandering round Muckross by meself. Da was awat. A forest surrounds the old manor hourse. I walked into the forest to be from the tourists I suppose. 

As I walked there was a bit of a clearing. I felt something touch my face. I thought it was silk. Some poor spider home I barged through. But no, it was a fasbulous gold colorur. It was delicte.It melted away like dry kindling in the fire. It reminded me of the stories. Da used to tell of the other folk. A tall beautiful sort. T'was important to keep your wits about you. 

I continued on and came on a yound man. Looked in his thirys, save for a few fair strands hidden in the black mop. He was away with it. O have no mond to hm and tried to walk past, not wanting to bother him. It was only when I passed he said "You're one of Maher's aren't you?" I don't know how he knew. He hardly looked at me. "Sure I might be" I says back to him. "We were told you'd be coming" he said. The golden threads danced around him like a cloud of ash. 

"You'll come by the hosue won't you?" he said. An instruction disguised as a question." I need to be back before the father gets worried" I said. "T'is no need for that Seamus, we'll have you sorted" he said. I followed the man along the forest. I spotted a well tread path. He kept tight to it. He didn't want to disturb those living in the tall grass. 

The trees began to part ways. We arrived at a grand farmhouse. Is roof was thatched with the golden thread. The very same kind that greeted me earlier A gold veneer covered the roof, fields, and paths. It gave everything a luster. It wasn't a cheap shine, a craftsman blessed this place. 

I thought to myself, where could it all have come from? It wuold have taken years to gather. Before I could ask the man already replied "It is a gift. Tuathal's spirit blessed this place. His hair normally fades away, but here it stays."

We continued on. The sights were something else. The thread was everywhere. It draped over crows like a veil, it flowed down the stream. I saw a man praying by the water. A few strands drapped over his bald head.

THe man brought me to a guest house on the property. I'd say there was room for no more than twenty folks in the little community. "This our guest Podge?" the barman said. My guide, Podge, have hm a nod. "We'll have you looked after don't worry. We just need a hand tomorrow and you'll be grand." The bartender said. He had these deep eyes you could get lost in. The blue, with strands of goldall around. It was something else. He poured me a pint. I suppose he knew what I liked by the head on me. "I'll be bacl in the morning. We need a hand at mass tomorrow." Podge said. He had already left  before I could protest, but who am I to reguse a favor for a priest. 

I return to my drink and the bartender. A few otherfolk dotted the place. They all had that gold shine about them. Podge said he was expecting me. "Have you any idea what he was on about?" I asked the barman. "It wasn't just chance. Tuathal said you'd come." He said. "I'm sorry, I don't know Tuathal." I said. "Tuathal gave us this gidt. His golden hair connects us all. He said you'd come, and here you are" the barman said.. The gold shimmer of them all. It was like they were all sharing some quiet song among themselves. 

The next day I was the talk of the town. I had breakdast in the pub and everyone was eager to say hello. I kept things as quirt as I could. Not like me to be the centre of attention. Podge came to fetch me and we arrived at a barn made up like a church. A few pews from lical timbre, a small cross on the alter. I twas no cathedral, but some thoought was put in. 

There was a bustle among the village. Podge brought some order as he stoof in front og the alter. He began a mass anyway. I didn;t know if it was a funny rregional mass or if I hadn't been to mass ina  while. THe cerman was all over the place. Eventually odge looks to me. "And the present the body and blood of Christ, Seamus will join me." The crowd of them were excited. A few whispers.
