# Chapter One

I walk home from work. My home is in view from across the estate. Living in a town has always appealed to me. Everything is close, but not claustrophobic like the city. No one ever calls it a city. The city is just "town". It is as if our tiny nation accepts that our biggest hub is humble on the world stage. I am a step removed from that again. Bigger than the village I grew up in, but smaller than "town". It is 18:20. I enjoy my work-life balance. The office is indifferent to my plans. Normally, I finish at 17:00. Dinner is done by 19:00, but today the kitchen is running late. 

I stop in the front garden. My body is warm. Was the walk that bad? I feel it in my cheeks. I have been lazy since starting the office job. The house is convenient. The kind of semi-detached you would see in any estate in Ireland. I make my way inside. "Mary, you home?" I say. The house is quiet. I make my way into the kitchen. My eyes are heavy. I move to the stove and perform the daily ritual. My body navigates the kitchen without much thought. I enjoy the gas stove. The smell of gas somehow made it feel more real. Seeing the little flame come to life after a click, click, click. A stainless steel pot is filled with water and comes to a boil. Fresh pasta slowly droops into the pot as it gives way to the heat. Looking up, I see a note on the extractor fan. "Pasta special x2," the note reads. The paper is thin and pink, with some additional sections left empty. Why would Mary leave a note for dinner? I strain the pasta before adding it to a shallow pan. Adding two egg yolks and parmesan, I agitate the pan until a smooth sauce coats the pasta. It is a simple dish, a staple from my college days. As I plate the meal, I ring the bell. Mary comes in from the adjoining room. There is faint chatter in the distance. It disappears as the door swings closed behind her. 

"Where were you? I was calling for you," I say. 

"I told you not to shout from across the kitchen," she says. Her voice is sharp. 

She is wearing a white shirt with black pants and a blazer. Her hair is tied back in a neat ponytail. 

"Since when do you wear suits?" I say.

She has the face of a mother who's been asked, "Are we there yet?" for the hundredth time. 

"Do you ever look outside this kitchen, John?" she says. Her eyes dart to the plates of pasta. She rolls her eyes as she neatly shaves slices of parmesan onto the dish. "Fine dining, John, we need to look the part, not just the food."

"What are you talking about, Mary? It's just dinner," I say.

"It's Maria for fuck sake, John, these people paid good money to be here," she says, picking up the plates and moving toward the next room. "There are more tickets, get going," she says, kicking the door open, letting it swing closed behind her. 

I catch a glance. The next room is full of people. From here, I can see a chandelier hanging high above ten, maybe twenty tables. It is packed. The door swings shut, and the chatter dampens again. The kitchen feels huge. Double-sized fridges cover one wall. Brushed metal cabinets have replaced my wooden shelves and presses. The floor is spotless. A knife bag is rolled out. A set of seven Victorinox knives stares back at me. Besides Mary, or Maria, they are the only thing that feels familiar in the kitchen.
