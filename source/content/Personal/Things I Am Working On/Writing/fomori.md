Prompt: A musical experience.

The night is young. John's head is pounding. How many drinks was it? Not enough. A crumbled ball of cash in his pocket. It is there to be spent. John leaves the quiet place. A few pints on the edge of town to warm up, and to dodge the inner city tax. The rain is welcome. It is a light mist to keep him cool. 

He picks up the pace dodging past the tourists and hen parties clogging the street. Each step a kick drumb as the clubs draw near. The city never stops growing. Passages swallow people whole as they pour into the clubs. He long accepted he would never visit them all, but what's the harm in trying. The city takes him down a path. Muffled music crashes in from all sides. The buildings were here before John, and they will cotinue after he is gone. 

John nestles himself between the heaving crowd of somewhere new. Fomori. The name dances in front of him from above the entrance. The place is a mix of purples and blues. The signs are weathered and cracking. As the crowd meanders closer he sees swirling patterns on the outsie wall. It looks like two colors of paint in the process of mixing. "You alright buddy?" the bouncer says. When did he reach the front of the queue? John gives the man a nod fighting the urge to sway. The bouncer cocks his head towards the door. 

The air is heavy inside. John spots a line to the dancefloor among the crowd. At the far end, a stage. As the room opens up familiar songs echo through the maw of the building. Speakers crush the notes into musical paste. The vocals are replaced with a choir of heathens. The crowd sways with the music. John stays in step, inching his way deeper toward the front. The stage is tangled mess of cables bowing at the middle. They are connected into worn out beige boxes with lights and dials. The speakers begin to fade out. A faint hiss is all that remains. The crowd snaps to a halt waiting for their next note. 

A white light lands on the stage. The crowd is frozen, fixated on the stage. The places goes cold. The crowd is miles away in the silence. The stage feels impossibly close. He could climb up perform if he had the courage.
