Over the last six months I have wanted an SLR camera. I love the feel of my current assortment of cameras. The Yashica MF-1 is my current darling. However, it is much more consumer grade. I enjoy the look and feel, but I have less control than I would like.

Charity shops and online marketplaces were my main focus. I cannot afford the luxury of a high end camera. Eventually, I landed on the Olympus OM10. It was available for â‚¬100 featuring a handful of accessories.
