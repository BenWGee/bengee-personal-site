# Open Mic
I found myself at an open mic night. The fourth run by a local couple. Nestled inside a cosy cafe there was a hum from the crowd. Once a newsagent, a bikeshop, and now a cafe. Above all, this is a home. Just beyond the coffee bar you could peak deeper into the building. A kitchen, a living room, coats, family. It is a place to be. 

I was not performing today, or so I thought. From my pocket I fiddled with the lever.Yashica MF-1, a camera older than me. Almost as old as my parents. This was a chance to try something new. Not wanting to disturb the intimate event the MC gave me thier blessing to shoot. At the top of the show they introduced me as their "photographer". While flattered, I know my own ability. I am a fool with a camera, and a couple notions in my head. But, with that the night began in earnest. I was there to listen, watch, and capture the moments. 

# Watcher
The mechanical charm of film brought a blessing and a curse. Twisting dials and levers brought me endless joy. The sensory spectacle felt selfish. Amidst the quiet atmosphere every click the shutter echoed in my mind. The sprockets rolled a beatiful uninvited sound. My goal was clear. Be a ghost. This was my first time shooting on a limited budget. I was armed with one roll of 100 ISO B&W film. Everyone needed their moment. Take the shot now, or wait for a better time? Is this the end of the song? Will they perform another? All these questions. As I write this I do not know the answer. The canister sits on my desk undeveloped. Results will soon come (and will be available in this article for you to enjoy too). For now, I am in the dark. 

# Using the Yashica MF-1
The MF-1 was a great camera for my first role as a "photographer". Size was key. Shooting at multiple angles, and staying out of the way was a breeze. The MF-1 also features a simplified focus ring. Four pictures show your effective range from portrait to infinite focus. Some numbers are visible too on the underside if you want to double check. 

The flash retracts to keep the camera compact. I found myself using it a lot. Our performers were well lit but light quickly diminshed into the crowd. I was hoping to use this to create a vingnette effect as we go from audience to performer in the shot.
